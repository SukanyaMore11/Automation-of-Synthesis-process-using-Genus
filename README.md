# Automation-of-Synthesis-process-using-Genus
## Introduction
This repository has been created to automate the entire process of synthesis on Genus. Anyone can synthesize thousands of modules using this code and will generate csv file containing power, timing and area information of all modules.
This Automation process will create sdc file with maximum clock frequency which which will give 0ps slack.
