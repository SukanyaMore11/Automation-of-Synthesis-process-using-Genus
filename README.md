# Automation-of-Synthesis-process-using-Genus
## Introduction
This repository has been created to automate the entire process of synthesis on Genus. Anyone can synthesize thousands of modules using this code and will generate csv file containing power, timing and area information of all modules.
This Automation process will create sdc file with maximum clock frequency which which will give 0ps slack.

## Content
This repository has following files and folders:
1. Python script will automate the synthesis flow in Genus
2. CSV files has power, delay and area report of FIFO, Two-Stage-Pipilined Processor, and Five-Stage Convolution modules.
3. Design folder contains all the design modules and testbench that we are synthesizing.
4. Script folder contains tcl scripts for all designs.
5. SDC folder contains time constraint files for all designs.
6. Synthesis folder contains text files of report generated by synthesis process of each design.
